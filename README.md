# Python Challenge:

## PyBank:

Tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll:

Tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process, I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## PyBoss:

Overseeing hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

Task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format and do the following:

* The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.

* The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.

* The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.

* The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

## PyParagraph:

As chief linguist, you are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. Having read so many passages, you've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.

Task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics by doing the following:

* Import a text file.

* Assess the passage for each of the following:

  * Approximate word count

  * Approximate sentence count

  * Approximate letter count (per word)

  * Average sentence length (in words)
